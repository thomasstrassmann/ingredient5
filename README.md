## Testing 

The page and its functionality was tested manually. This was done primarily using Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse), as well as the website http://www.responsinator.com/.
The layout was tested in portrait and landscape mode on the following devices: iPhone SE, iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 5, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Surface Pro 7, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold, Samsung Galaxy A51/71, Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max and common monitors. No display errors were detected. If other devices show any, they would have to be improved afterwards. 

To test accessibility and SEO, Lighthouse was used.

Furthermore, the W3C Validator was used to ensure that the HTML and CSS file are valid. No errors exist anymore at this moment. JShint was used to find errors in JavaScript code. In the corrected version there are currently only hints that some techniques can only be used with ES6, so the code is valid.
